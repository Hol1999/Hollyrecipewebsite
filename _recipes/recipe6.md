### Difficulty: \* Time: \*

## Ingredients

* One large buffalo tomato
* Ciabatta
* Basil
* Olive Oil
* Balsamic Vinegar
* Salt
* Pepper
* 1 or 2 cloves of garlic

## Method

Chop finely the tomato

Toast the ciabatta in a pan, with some olive oil. Turn on both sides and make sure it's a nice golden colour.

In a bowl, add the tomato, and a drizzle of olive oil and balsamic vinegar with some salt and pepper. Add some finely chopped garlic and stir.

Top the tomato mixture on the ciabatta with some fresh basil or instead eat with a side of rocket, anchovies and a poached egg. 

There we go, that's it. Done!
