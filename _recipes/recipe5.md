### Difficulty:\*   Time: \**

## Ingredients

* Cherry tomatoes
* Block of feta
* Olive oil
* ½ Garlic
* Basil
* Pasta of choice (I chose Spirali)
* Salt
* Pepper

## Method

Preheat the oven to 200℃ (or 180 ℃ Fan)

In a baking dish place the cherry tomatoes, with a good helping of olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Mix them together.

Then add the block of feta right in the centre, drizzle the feta with more olive oil, salt and pepper. It is now ready for the oven, for 35 minutes.

When it's done, add some finely chopped fresh garlic and some basil (dried basil is also fine), then stir until all is combined nicely.

Add the cooked pasta with the feta, tomato, garlicky goodness!

Then it’s time to eat...
