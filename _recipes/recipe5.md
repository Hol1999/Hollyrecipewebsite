Spirali is a nickname for the Italian pasta named after their word for 'corkscrew' Cavatappi. Its alternative names are quite humorous 'Serpentini' and 'double elbows'.  It is a common choice for macaroni recipes.

##### Difficulty: \* Time : \**

### Ingredients

* Cherry tomatoes
* Block of feta
* Olive oil
* ½ Garlic
* Basil
* Pasta of choice (I chose Spirali)
* Salt
* Pepper

### Method

i. Preheat the oven to 200℃ (or 180 ℃ Fan)

ii. In a baking dish place the cherry tomatoes, with a good helping of olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Mix them together.

iii. Then add the block of feta right in the centre, drizzle the feta with more olive oil, salt and pepper. It is now ready for the oven, for 35 minutes.

iv. When it's done, add some finely chopped fresh garlic and some basil (dried basil is also fine), then stir until all is combined nicely.

v. Add the cooked pasta with the feta, tomato, garlicky goodness!

Then it’s time to eat...

#### Here's the one I made, it made about 5 portions in the end. To reheat, place in the microwave for 3 mins (700 watts) stirring halfway, I also found that it tasted better days later - tornbetween.
