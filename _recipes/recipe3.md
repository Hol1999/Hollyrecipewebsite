## Method

Make the meat sauce by...

Make the bechamel sauce by melting the butter in a pan, stirring in the flour. Cook over a gentle heat for 2-3 mins, then gradually beating in the milk until the sauce is thick.  Season with nutmeg, salt, pepper and cook for 5-10 mins.

To layer, place a bit of the meat sauce in the baking dish, cover with a sheet of lasagna, add another layer of meat sauce and then add some bechamel sauce, continue layering in this fashion until you run out of ingredients. Finish with a layer of bechamel. 

Sprinkle with some grated parmesan and dollop some butter here and there on top of the last bechamel sauce layer. Place in the oven (preheated) at 230oc (210 Fan) for 30 mins.

Voila!
