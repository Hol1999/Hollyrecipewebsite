Hi ~ I'm the editor of *tornbetween,* and this weeks theme is inspiration. I will be talking about: Why I chose an Italian inspired blog; Where my recipes are taken from; What books will inspire my internal pages and cover design of my eBook (which will be coming out soon); Some of my favourite book covers and why I like them and what makes a good book cover; And lastly, how eBook covers differ from physical printed copies.

~ Why I chose an Italian inspired blog: As I was searching 2021 trends following the events of COVID-19, expert connoisseurs expect plant-based foods, veganism, nutrition-hacking and comfort foods to be what the everyman will be seen to revert towards. The recipes I have chosen are packed full of healthy ingredients, are vegetarian and definitely comforting!  

~ Where my recipes are taken from: Since COVID caused mayhem to our social lives, I gained exponentially more free time, and one app has worked its way into my everyday life...TikTok. And with TikTok's amazing algorithms a lot of food content has been on my 'for you page'. Users like @alphafoodie, @imp_of_the_perverse and @feelgoodfoodie to name a few. 

~ What books will inspire my internal pages and cover design of my eBook: One of my favourite cookbooks being *The Hungoevr Coobkook*, (spelling intended to mimic the hangover slur), its content is witty and self-deprecating has some genius placements, stunning illustrations and my personal favourite difficulty and time ratings. Which, for a lazy cook like myself is a great idea! Another cookbook is *Eat. Nourish. Glow,* it's Freer's internal pages that speak volumes and evoke a sensation that the book itself is more like a work of art than a nutritional guidance book. 

~ Some of my favourite book covers and why I like them: Looking at my book collection a lot of my book covers have a person on the cover either full-body or half, illustrated (in the case of fiction or art books) and photography (in the case of cookbooks). My favourites being *Modern Life* (Jean Jullien) and again *Eat. Nourish. Glow,* as it is in my direct sight of vision and looks, in my humble opinion the perfect example of a book cover. It seems I am unconsciously drawn to this type of cover, ones that I dislike in comparison are *The Hungry Student Cookbook,* with 50 Shades of Orange and illustrated in a simplistic fashion. 

~ What makes a good book cover: This is relatively simple, as long as you follow some simple rules, a cover won't look terrible even if your imagination is impaired. Typography has to be legible, the quality of the imagery has to be good enough that you can't see a pixel or a blur. The cover needs to be coherent and have some sense of order to it. To make a *good* cover though it needs to be interesting, for example, it should convey some sort of emotion or story and have some sort of identity - so if a person were to look at my recipe eBook cover they need to know immediately that it is a recipe book and not a fantasy fiction book. Colour, imagery, typography should be aesthetically coherent. This is what I intend to convey through my eBook cover.

~ How eBook covers differ from physical printed copies: The margin of sight of say a Kindle of one eBook is a lot smaller than a physical normal-sized cookbook and so what I create has to be legible in some shape or form on such a small scale. 

## 'What I have done so far' segment 

* Today, I cooked my first recipe '*Feta, Tomato and Basil Spirali*', took a bunch of pictures and will upload the recipe soon. It was delicious, it is definetely worth recreating if you have some time. Here's a photo x
