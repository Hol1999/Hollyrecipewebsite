Good afternoon! The topic of my blog today is Adobe InDesign. I'll be talking about how 'style terms' differ in comparison to those used in CSS. What the difference is between character and paragraph styles and...









Links and further references to what I spoke about, including a YouTube video on InDesign paragraph styles and characters styles. And links to CSS and InDesign terms:

1. If you're looking for an extensive list of definitions for InDesign terms, click this [link](https://www.paperandoats.com/blog-native/31-adobe-indesign-terms-defined). 
2. If you're instead hoping for a vast list of CSS terms this [link](https://www.impressivewebs.com/css-terms-definitions/) is for you.

### 'What I've done so far' segment

* So since moving on to the last stage of my assignment, I have upload my five recipes to InDesign and started designing them in the fashion of an eBook.
