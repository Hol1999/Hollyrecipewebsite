Hi, I'm the editor of tornbetween! I'm not Italian but I love the flavours of their cuisine. I hope you get to try some of these recipes, they're not difficult and you can often batch cook them if you're just cooking for yourself. As for my blog content, the work goes towards a digital assignment, if you're curious.
